## What I Built (End-to-End Production-Ready Analytics)

| Component                      | What It Does                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Cleaning & EDA           | Robust handling of real-world messiness (missing values, encoding issues)    |
| Feature Engineering           | 12+ high-impact features (tenure groups, service count, risk flags)          |
| Modeling                      | XGBoost trained on full dataset → **0.84–0.86 AUC**                           |
| Business Logic                | Rule-based retention recommendations per customer (contract discounts, upselling, etc.) |
| Interactive Dashboard         | Streamlit app with predictions table, summary stats, visualizations, and **high-risk segmentation by contract** |
| One-Click Reporting           | Download full results as CSV or **professional PDF report**                  |
| Deployment                    | Fully deployed on Streamlit Cloud — zero setup for stakeholders              |

## Key Business Insights (Directly from the Model)

- **Month-to-month contracts** are the #1 churn driver (often >40% risk) → target with loyalty discounts
- **Fiber optic customers** churn 2× more → service quality issue
- Customers without **TechSupport** or with **few add-ons** are high risk → perfect upsell targets
- **Electronic check** payment = strong red flag
